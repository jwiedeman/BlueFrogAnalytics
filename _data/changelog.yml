  date: Feb 10, 2021
  list:
  - IOS 14.5 update will cause many tracking issues with the facebook pixel. Facebook internal teams are execting up to a 30% drop in conversions, although apple is allowing facebook 8 total events to fire which will cover all ecom pixel events. It has yet to be seen how this will impact pixel ad preformance.
