# Sensor Fusion Bot (Python)

This experimental tool combines capabilities from the existing Recon test runner
and a lightweight technology fingerprinting engine inspired by Wappalyzer. It
reuses the dynamic test loading system from `BOT-Recon_[Py]` and adds a new test
which runs the custom detector against a target domain.

Run `main.py` with the same flags as the Recon bot. Additional options allow
invoking the Wappalyzer fingerprinting engine directly:

```bash
python main.py --target example.com --all --verbose
# run full suite

# Run only the fingerprinting engine
python main.py --target example.com --fingerprint-only

# Fingerprint first then run selected tests
python main.py --target example.com --fingerprint --tests test_ssl test_whois
```

The new test `test_wappalyzer_integration.py` attempts multiple HTTP/HTTPS
variants of the target until technology fingerprints are found using the custom
detector.

To expose Wappalyzer's technology database to the rest of the tests a helper
module `wappalyzer_data.py` loads the `technologies.json` file. A local copy of
`technologies.json`, `categories.json` and `groups.json` is stored under the
`data/` directory. The helper exposes `get_detector()` which returns a simple
object wrapping the matcher. A convenience `load_full_wappalyzer_data()`
function returns the raw groups, categories and technologies dictionaries for
custom analysis.

The repository includes the full technology set compiled from the original
Wappalyzer project. Run `scripts/compile_technologies.py` to rebuild
`data/technologies.json` from the JSON files in `../BOT-wappalyzer[Py]/src/technologies`.
The precompiled file contains over 5,000 technology definitions.

All existing tests from `BOT-Recon_[Py]` are discovered automatically, allowing
the full reconnaissance suite to run alongside the Wappalyzer fingerprinting.

## Additional Tests

A second test `test_crosscheck_server.py` compares the server detection output from
`BOT-Recon_[Py]`'s `test_server_fingerprinting.py` with Wappalyzer results. It
reports any overlap between the two techniques to help validate fingerprinting
accuracy.

The third test `test_wappalyzer_categories.py` lists detected technologies along
with their versions, categories and groups for quick reference.

The new test `test_wappalyzer_dataset.py` demonstrates loading the raw
categories and technologies using `wappalyzer_data` and runs detection through
the custom engine.

`test_simple_matcher.py` demonstrates the bundled matcher in
`wappalyzer_matcher.py`. It now mirrors Wappalyzer's logic for URL,
header, HTML, script, cookie and meta pattern checks and resolves implied
technologies. The matcher also supports basic JS, DOM and DNS rules.
Versions, categories and highâ€‘level groups are exposed for each detected
technology along with an aggregate confidence score calculated from the
matched patterns.
