# Domain Enrichment Processor

This worker enriches rows in the `domains_processed` table with
network, geolocation and website metadata.  It resolves each domain,
runs several scanners and then updates Cassandra with the results.

## What it does
- GeoIP lookups for city, region, country and timezone
- ASN and ISP identification
- SSL certificate issuer extraction
- Homepage analysis (title, description, contact details)
- Basic content scraping for phone numbers and emails
- Technology detection using a local Wappalyzer build
- Sitemap size counting

Only domains marked `user_managed = true` are processed.  If a site is
unreachable its `status` field is set to `false`.

## Required files
- `GeoLite2-City.mmdb`
- `GeoLite2-ASN.mmdb`
- Local patched copy of `Wappalyzer` inside this directory

## Running locally
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python enrich_processed_domain.py --status-true-only
```

## Docker
```bash
docker build -t domain-enricher .
docker run --rm \
  -v $(pwd):/app \
  --network=host \
  domain-enricher
```

`--network=host` is required so the container can reach your Cassandra
cluster.
