# **How Tracking Works: A High-Level Overview**

Digital tracking is a **process of collecting and analyzing data** about user interactions on websites and applications. At its core, tracking enables businesses to understand how visitors engage with their digital properties, optimize user experiences, and drive effective marketing strategies. Whether through cookies, tags, or event tracking, the goal is to gather insights that help improve both the website’s performance and the overall customer journey.

##**Overview**

Tracking works by recording specific user actions—such as pageviews, clicks, form submissions, and other interactions—and sending that information to analytics platforms. This data is then processed and analyzed to provide insights into visitor behavior, campaign performance, and conversion paths. By using various methods like cookies and data layers, tracking helps create a unified view of user activity across different devices and channels.

##**History & Evolution**

- **Early Days:** In the early days of the web, tracking was limited to simple pageview counts and basic user interactions. Early methods primarily relied on static images or small text files (cookies) to collect data.
- **Advancements:** As websites evolved to become more interactive, tracking methods expanded to include JavaScript-based tags, event tracking, and data layers. This allowed for more granular measurement of user actions.
- **Modern Era:** Today, tracking encompasses a wide range of technologies, from first and third party cookies to advanced event-based tracking, and is integrated into sophisticated analytics platforms that provide real-time insights and predictive analytics.
