# **First Party vs Third Party Cookies**

Hello, world!

## **📌 Overview**  
Cookies are small text files stored on a user's browser that help websites remember information about their visit. There are two primary types of cookies: **first party cookies** and **third party cookies**. First party cookies are set by the website a user is visiting, while third party cookies are set by external domains that provide additional services such as advertising, analytics, or social media integrations. Understanding the differences between these cookies is essential for managing privacy, tracking user behavior, and optimizing digital marketing strategies.

✅ **Best For:** Marketers, web developers, and privacy professionals looking to balance user experience with compliance and data accuracy.  
✅ **Core Concepts:** **First party cookies** offer a more privacy-friendly approach with direct control by the website owner, while **third party cookies** allow broader tracking across multiple sites but raise privacy concerns.

## **📜 History & Evolution**  
The use of cookies began in the mid-1990s to enhance user experience by storing session data. As the web evolved, third party cookies emerged to facilitate cross-site tracking for advertising and analytics. Over time, increasing privacy concerns and regulatory changes (such as GDPR and CCPA) have led to significant shifts:

- **1990s:** Cookies introduced as a means to manage user sessions and enhance website functionality.
- **Early 2000s:** Emergence of third party cookies allowed advertisers to track users across multiple websites.
- **2010s:** Privacy concerns mount as third party tracking becomes widespread, prompting debates over user consent.
- **2020-Present:** Modern browsers and regulatory bodies increasingly restrict third party cookies, pushing the industry towards first party data strategies and alternative tracking methods.

## **⚙️ Key Differences**

### **First Party Cookies**
✔ **Set by the visited website:** They are created and stored by the site a user is actively visiting.
✔ **Privacy-Friendly:** Generally considered less intrusive as they are used to improve user experience (e.g., remembering login details, preferences).
✔ **Controlled by the Site Owner:** Data is managed directly by the website, making it easier to comply with privacy regulations.

### **Third Party Cookies**
✔ **Set by External Domains:** Created by domains other than the one a user is visiting, often used for advertising, tracking, and analytics.
✔ **Broader Tracking:** Enable tracking of user behavior across multiple websites, which helps build detailed user profiles.
✔ **Privacy Concerns:** They have become controversial due to potential misuse of personal data and have led to increased regulatory scrutiny and browser restrictions.
