 **Enforcement Rule** – Outlines penalties for non-compliance and investigative procedures.  

### **Technical & Operational Requirements**
 **Access Controls & Authentication** – Restrict data access to authorized personnel.  
 **Encryption & Secure Storage** – Encrypt ePHI both in transit and at rest.  
 **Audit Trails & Activity Monitoring** – Maintain logs of data access and modifications.  
 **Employee Training & Awareness** – Educate staff on HIPAA policies and cybersecurity best practices.  
 **Incident Response & Breach Notification** – Establish protocols for reporting and mitigating security incidents.
