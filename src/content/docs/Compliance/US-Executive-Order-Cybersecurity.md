-**Private Sector (Critical Infrastructure):** Possible **FTC enforcement** and **legal liability** for breaches.  
-**Civil & Criminal Penalties:** Executives may face **fines and legal consequences** for gross negligence in cybersecurity failures.  

### **Legal Actions & Lawsuits**
-**Federal Investigations** *(Failure to comply may result in regulatory audits.)*  
-**Class-Action Lawsuits** *(Customers affected by breaches may sue for damages.)*  
-**Government Contract Bans** *(Companies failing cybersecurity audits may be blacklisted from federal contracts.)*  

### **Business Impact**
-**Reputation Damage** *(Loss of customer and partner trust.)*  
-**Regulatory Sanctions** *(Increased scrutiny and required remediation efforts.)*  
-**Increased Compliance Costs** *(Additional cybersecurity investments needed to meet requirements.)*
