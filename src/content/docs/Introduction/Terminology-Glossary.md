---

## A

### A/B Testing

A method of comparing two versions of a webpage, ad, or email to learn which drives better results.\
**Common arenas:** CRO, PPC, email. **Typical metrics:** click-through rate (CTR), conversion rate, bounce rate.

### Abandonment Rate

The percentage of users who start but don't finish a desired action (checkout, form, video, etc.). A core signal for conversion-flow triage.

### Above the Fold

The portion of a page visible without scrolling. **SEO/UX tip:** park your primary CTA, value prop, and proof points here.

### Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP)

A Google-backed framework that strips bloaty markup for lightning-fast mobile loads.\
**Pros:** speed, SERP carousel eligibility. **Cons:** design limits, Google cache dependency.

### Accessibility

Designing content so people with disabilities can use it. Guided by WCAG. Bonus: better UX + potential ranking lift.

### Account-Based Marketing

B2B strategy that targets high-value accounts with hyper-personalized, multi-channel campaigns instead of broad personas.

### Actionable Analytics

Insights translated directly into clear, measurable actions---no ivory-tower data pontificating allowed.

### Ad Extensions

Extra bits that expand a Google Ad: sitelinks, calls, locations, snippets, et al. Boost CTR and Quality Score when used well.

### Ad Fatigue

Performance decay caused by over-exposure to the same creative. Cure with fresh assets, tightened frequency caps, or new targets.

### Ad Impression

A single display of an ad, click or no click. Fundamental denominator for CPM and view-through math.

### Ad Inventory

### Average Position

Legacy Google Ads metric for mean SERP slot---sunset in 2019, replaced by impression-share top stats.
