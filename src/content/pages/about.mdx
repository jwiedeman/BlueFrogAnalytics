      <p>
        Welcome to <strong>Blue Frog Analytics</strong>&mdash;a platform born out of firsthand
        experience and an unwavering desire to empower businesses. My journey as an analytics
        engineer opened my eyes to the intricate challenges faced by teams across all disciplines.
        From developers and marketers to compliance experts, I witnessed how fragmented processes
        and misaligned tools can cause friction in everyday operations.

      <h3 className="h3">The Vision</h3>
      <p>At its core, Blue Frog Analytics is about <strong>optimizing efficiency</strong>. I envisioned a single solution that:</p>
      <div className="row text-center gy-4">
        {[
          ['bi bi-gear-fill', 'Streamlines complex workflows'],
          ['bi bi-bar-chart-line-fill', 'Integrates critical insights across tracking, SEO, performance, and compliance'],
          ['bi bi-lightning-charge-fill', 'Eliminates the friction that slows business processes']
        ].map(([icon, text]) => (
          <div key={text} className="col-md-4">
            <i className={`${icon} display-5 text-primary`}></i>
            <p className="mt-2 mb-0">{text}</p>
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
      <p>
        Blue Frog Analytics isn't just another auditing tool&mdash;it's the grease in the gears that keeps
        the machinery of modern business running smoothly. Our goal is to help teams make informed
        decisions quickly, reduce operational headaches, and ultimately, boost overall performance.

      <h3 className="h3">The Problem I Saw</h3>
      <p>During my time working in analytics, I noticed:</p>
      <div className="row text-center gy-4">
        {[
          ['bi bi-database-fill-gear', 'Siloed Data & Tools: each department using its own system created redundancies and disconnects.'],
          ['bi bi-eye-slash-fill', 'Missed Opportunities: critical insights were hidden in complex data and often delayed.'],
          ['bi bi-hourglass-split', 'Inefficiencies: too much time spent switching between platforms for a full picture.']
        ].map(([icon, text]) => (
          <div key={text} className="col-md-4">
            <i className={`${icon} display-5 text-primary`}></i>
            <p className="mt-2 mb-0">{text}</p>
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
      <p>
        These challenges not only impacted day-to-day operations but also stifled innovation and growth.
        It became clear that what was needed was a <strong>one-stop solution</strong> that could address these pain points head-on.
