1. Dry Heat Cooking

Dry heat cooking works without the presence of any moisture, broth, or water. Instead, it relies on the circulation of hot air or contact with fat to transfer heat to foods. Temperatures of 300 degrees or hotter are used to create browning, a reaction where the amino acids and sugars in food turn brown and create a distinct aroma and flavor. The unique scents of toasted bread or seared meat are both examples of dry heat cooking at work.

Roasting
Roasting is performed inside an oven and uses indirect heat that cooks from all sides for even browning. This method of cooking works more slowly, coaxing flavors out of meats and vegetables. Roasting can be performed at very low temperatures between 200 degrees and 350 degrees Fahrenheit for tougher cuts of meat, or higher temperatures up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit for more tender cuts.

Best foods for roasting:

Meats: Roasting cooks large cuts of meat slowly and evenly. Prime rib, beef tenderloin, pork butt or shoulder, and pork loin all benefit from roasting.
Poultry: Whole chickens or turkeys can be placed in a roasting pan or on a rotisserie spit and cooked for several hours for a moist and flavorful product.
Fruits and Veggies: Roasting is a great way to bring out the best qualities in fruits and vegetables. Grapes, cherries, and tomatoes can be roasted to intensify their flavors. Pumpkin, squash, eggplant, and cauliflower are also excellent candidates for roasting.
