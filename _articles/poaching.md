Moist Heat Cooking

As the name indicates, moist heat cooking relies on the presence of liquid or steam to cook foods. This method can be used to make healthy dishes without any added fat or oil. It's also a great way to tenderize the tough fibers in certain cuts of meat, like beef chuck or brisket. When cooking fibrous vegetables and legumes, moist heat cooking softens the food until it reaches the perfect tenderness. Unlike dry heat cooking methods, moist heat cooking will not produce a browned crust.

Poaching
Poaching is a gentle method of cooking in which foods are submerged in hot liquid between 140 degrees and 180 degrees Fahrenheit. The low heat works especially well for delicate items, and moisture and flavor are preserved without the need for fat or oil.

Best foods for poaching:

Eggs: Poaching is a common method of cooking eggs that results in a soft, tender egg white and creamy yolk. No oil is needed so it's more health-conscious than pan frying.
Poultry: Broth, wine, or aromatics can be used for poaching liquid, which adds flavor to boneless, skinless chicken breasts. The result is tender chicken that can be cubed, sliced, or shredded and added to salads, pasta, or sandwiches.
Fish: Poaching is a great way to preserve the delicate texture of light fish like tilapia, cod, and sole. A special broth, called court bouillon, is used to add flavor to the fish as it cooks.
Fruit: Use a sweetened liquid to poach fruits like pears or apples for a unique dessert. The flavor of the fruit is deepened and the texture becomes soft and tender. Any leftover liquid can be used to make a flavored syrup to serve with the fruit.
