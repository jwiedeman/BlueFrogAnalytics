1. Dry Heat Cooking

Dry heat cooking works without the presence of any moisture, broth, or water. Instead, it relies on the circulation of hot air or contact with fat to transfer heat to foods. Temperatures of 300 degrees or hotter are used to create browning, a reaction where the amino acids and sugars in food turn brown and create a distinct aroma and flavor. The unique scents of toasted bread or seared meat are both examples of dry heat cooking at work.

Baking
Baking and roasting both use indirect heat to surround foods and cook from all sides. The term roasting is used when cooking meats or vegetables, and baking is used when making bread, rolls, and cakes. Technically, these cooking methods are the same, but baking is usually performed at lower temperatures than roasting.

Best foods for baking:

Baked Goods: Baking transforms wet dough or batter into a final product with a firm texture. Bread, pastries, and cakes are all baked.
Pizza: As pizzas are baked in a hot oven, the dough becomes firm, a crust is formed, and the cheese topping melts.
