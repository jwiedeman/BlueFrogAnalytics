1. Dry Heat Cooking

Dry heat cooking works without the presence of any moisture, broth, or water. Instead, it relies on the circulation of hot air or contact with fat to transfer heat to foods. Temperatures of 300 degrees or hotter are used to create browning, a reaction where the amino acids and sugars in food turn brown and create a distinct aroma and flavor. The unique scents of toasted bread or seared meat are both examples of dry heat cooking at work.

Broiling
Broiling works by transferring extremely high heat onto food, usually directed from a radiant located above the food which cooks on one side at a time. Browning can occur very quickly with this method, sealing juices and flavor inside and leaving a crisp exterior. Because this cooking method is fast, it's helpful to use a timer or check the doneness so foods don't become burnt or overcooked. In commercial kitchens, broiling can be performed with a salamander or broiler oven.

Best foods for broiling:

Meats: Broiling works best on thinner cuts of meat, like steaks, pork chops, or hamburger patties. Tender cuts are preferred because the dry heat will quickly evaporate moisture and dry out the meat.
Poultry: Use chicken or turkey cutlets, breast halves, quarters, and legs in the broiler for flavorful results.
Fish: Choose thick, sturdy fish, like salmon, that can handle high heat and won't dry out easily.
Fruits and Veggies: Broiling can even be used on fruits and vegetables. Try broiling peaches or grapefruit for a unique menu item.
