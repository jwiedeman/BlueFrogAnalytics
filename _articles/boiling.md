2. Moist Heat Cooking

As the name indicates, moist heat cooking relies on the presence of liquid or steam to cook foods. This method can be used to make healthy dishes without any added fat or oil. It's also a great way to tenderize the tough fibers in certain cuts of meat, like beef chuck or brisket. When cooking fibrous vegetables and legumes, moist heat cooking softens the food until it reaches the perfect tenderness. Unlike dry heat cooking methods, moist heat cooking will not produce a browned crust.

This cooking technique involves submerging food in water that has been heated to the boiling point of 212 degrees Fahrenheit. The boiling water produces large bubbles, which keep foods in motion while they cook. The expression slow boil means that the water has just started to produce large, slow-moving bubbles but is not quite heated to the boiling temperature. A full boil occurs at the boiling point and results in fast-moving, rolling bubbles. Steam is also released from the water as it boils.

Best foods for boiling:

Pasta: Pasta may come to mind as one of the most commonly boiled foods. The hot water cooks the pasta quickly so that it can be removed from the water before starches break down, preventing a mushy texture.
Eggs: Boiling eggs in their shell produces hard- or soft-boiled eggs. The texture of the yolk can range from firm to creamy, depending on the cook time.
Vegetables: Tough root vegetables like potatoes and carrots will cook more quickly in boiling water but it's recommended to test their tenderness with a fork so they don't overcook.
