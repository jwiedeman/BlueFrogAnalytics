title: Shooter Sandwich
subtitle: This English sandwich is definitely different, but really hearty and yummy. It is great to eat on camping trips or to send with your hubby while he is hunting. This recipe is very basic in measurements and can be adjusted as desired for the most part. The doneness of the meat can be adjusted as well. Hope you like it!
