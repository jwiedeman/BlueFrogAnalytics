- [ ] Boil beef shank in water, about 45 min. 
- [ ] Add vegetables, salt, possibly a little lovage or Maggi sauce and simmer for 20 more min.
- [ ] Cook noodles separately, so that the soup remains clear, and add to soup when done together with the egg dumplings. 
- [ ] You can vary the vegetable ingredients, but don't use too many … the broth clarity is to be preserved. 
- [ ] If preferred, remove meat from bone before serving or add a few pieces of beef cubes together with the shank.
