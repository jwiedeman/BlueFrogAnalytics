3. Combination Cooking

Combination cooking utilizes both dry and moist cooking methods. Foods are cooked in liquids at low heat for an extended period of time, resulting in a fork tender product. This technique works with the toughest cuts of meat, gradually breaking down fibers until they melt into the liquid.

Stewing
The key difference between stewing and braising is that foods are completely submerged in hot liquid while stewing instead of being partially submerged. Smaller cuts of meat are used in a stew, but the method of slow cooking at low heat is the same. As the stew cooks, fibrous vegetables break down and fat and collagen from the meats melt away. The result is a thick, flavorful gravy filled with tender bites of meat and soft vegetables.

Best foods for stewing:

Meats: Meats that are rich in collagen and fat do well in a stew pot. Avoid lean cuts and choose brisket, oxtail, or chuck roast.
Vegetables: Vegetables add depth to your stews. Onions, carrots, potatoes, and celery are common choices for building a stew, but also consider parsnips, turnips, or rutabaga.
