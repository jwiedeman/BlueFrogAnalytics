Dry Heat Cooking

Dry heat cooking works without the presence of any moisture, broth, or water. Instead, it relies on the circulation of hot air or contact with fat to transfer heat to foods. Temperatures of 300 degrees or hotter are used to create browning, a reaction where the amino acids and sugars in food turn brown and create a distinct aroma and flavor. The unique scents of toasted bread or seared meat are both examples of dry heat cooking at work.

Grilling
Grilling is similar to broiling, in that it uses radiant heat to cook foods quickly. Most commonly, grilling equipment will feature an open grate with a heat source located beneath the food. Flipping is required to cook foods on both sides and grill marks from the hot grate or rack are desirable.

Best foods for grilling:

Burgers: Ground hamburger meat is moist and cooks up very well on a hot grill. The high heat sears the outside of the patty for delicious charred flavor.
Meats: The dry heat from grilling will quickly remove moisture from meat so it's best to choose tender cuts or marinate the meat first. Ribeyes, porterhouses, t-bones, and strip steaks have higher fat content and marbling that produces a succulent grilled steak.
Poultry: Boneless cuts of chicken work best because they will grill more evenly. Whole chickens can be grilled, but spatchcocking is recommended.
Fish: Salmon, tuna, and swordfish steaks are sturdy enough for the grill and won't dry out quickly. It's possible to wrap fish in foil before placing it on the grates to prevent it from falling through.
