- [ ] Drain the soaked peas and rinse in cold water. Set aside. Fry the bacon in a large saucepan for a few minutes over medium heat until the fat starts to run, then stir in the onion and potato. Continue to fry for 5 minutes until softened.
- [ ] Add the peas, broth, herbs and pepper to taste. Bring to the boil, stirring once or twice, and allow to boil for 5 minutes. Then partially cover the pan and turn the heat down to a gentle simmer, stirring occasionally.
- [ ] Cook for 30 to 40 minutes until thickened and the peas are soft. If you like you can blend the soup in a food processor or blender, but it looks more wholesome with a rustic chunkiness. Prepare the Frankfurters according to instructions on the packaging. Check the seasoning and add salt if required. If you have used ham stock you may not need it. Sprinkle with a little chopped fresh parsley or chervil if desired and garnish with the Frankfurters.
