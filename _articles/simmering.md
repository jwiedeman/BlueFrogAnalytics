Moist Heat Cooking

As the name indicates, moist heat cooking relies on the presence of liquid or steam to cook foods. This method can be used to make healthy dishes without any added fat or oil. It's also a great way to tenderize the tough fibers in certain cuts of meat, like beef chuck or brisket. When cooking fibrous vegetables and legumes, moist heat cooking softens the food until it reaches the perfect tenderness. Unlike dry heat cooking methods, moist heat cooking will not produce a browned crust.

Simmering
Simmering is also a gentle method of cooking foods but uses higher temperatures than poaching, usually between 180 degrees and 205 degrees Fahrenheit. This temperature range lies below the boiling point and produces tiny bubbles. To achieve a simmer, first bring water to the boiling point and then lower the temperature.

Best foods for simmering:

Rice: Simmering produces cooked rice with a light, fluffy texture. Using water that is boiling or too hot causes the rice to become sticky and dry.
Meats: Choose tougher cuts of meat that will release fat and collagen as they simmer, like chuck roast.
Soups and Stocks: Because simmering releases the fat and proteins from meat, it produces a rich flavorful broth that can be used in soups or stews.
Vegetables: Tough root vegetables like potatoes and carrots are cooked to the perfect texture with gentle simmering.
Grains: Grains like quinoa, oats, or millet can be simmered until they reach a soft edible texture. Hot cereal is made by simmering grains until most of the water has evaporated, creating a smooth porridge.
Legumes: Dried beans and legumes are simmered to achieve a soft, edible texture. Some types of beans, like lentils, cook quickly, while others take several hours of gentle simmering to become fully cooked.
