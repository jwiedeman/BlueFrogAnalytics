Combination Cooking

Combination cooking utilizes both dry and moist cooking methods. Foods are cooked in liquids at low heat for an extended period of time, resulting in a fork tender product. This technique works with the toughest cuts of meat, gradually breaking down fibers until they melt into the liquid.

Braising
During braising, foods are first seared in a hot oiled pan then transferred to a larger pot to cook in hot liquid. The foods are only partially submerged in simmering water, broth, or stock. Using low heat, the foods soften over an extended cook time and the liquid becomes reduced with intensified flavors. Braising is a great method for producing fork tender meats that fall off the bone.

Best foods for braising:

Meats: Braising is most commonly used with cheaper, tougher cuts of meat because it softens and tenderizes the muscle fibers. Choose pork shoulder, chuck roast, or lamb shank.
Vegetables: Vegetables can be braised along with meat to add more flavor, or they can be braised alone as their own dish. Root vegetables like potatoes, beets, and turnips are softened during braising. Celery and fennel also respond well to braising, absorbing liquid but maintaining a firm texture.
Legumes: Lentils, chickpeas, and green beans can be braised in broth or wine for a texture that's soft but not mushy.
