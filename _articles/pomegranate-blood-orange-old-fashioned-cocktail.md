Blood orange is a winter season citrus fruit with maroon flesh and a sweet flavor with a hint of something akin to raspberry. Pomegranate juice has, of course, been a fad for several years, but this recipe calls for the arils, or seeds. If you donâ€™t feel like cracking open a fresh pomegranate yourself, the arils can be purchased already extracted and often packaged in bags at many supermarkets.

### Ingredients

- 2 lengths of blood orange peel
- 1 teaspoon pomegranate arils (seeds)
- 1 teaspoon granulated sugar
- 2 dashes Angostura bitters
- 2 ounces vodka (such as Grey Goose)
- Garnish: blood orange twist
