Moist Heat Cooking

As the name indicates, moist heat cooking relies on the presence of liquid or steam to cook foods. This method can be used to make healthy dishes without any added fat or oil. It's also a great way to tenderize the tough fibers in certain cuts of meat, like beef chuck or brisket. When cooking fibrous vegetables and legumes, moist heat cooking softens the food until it reaches the perfect tenderness. Unlike dry heat cooking methods, moist heat cooking will not produce a browned crust.

Steaming
In steaming, water is boiled continuously to produce a steady amount of steam. The steam surrounds foods and cooks evenly while retaining moisture. Steaming can be performed in a few different ways. For high volume kitchens, a commercial steamer or combi oven is the most efficient. Other methods of steaming include using a pot and steamer basket, using a microwave, or wrapping foods in foil so they can steam in the oven.

Best foods for steaming:

Vegetables: Most vegetables can be steamed with great results. Sturdy veggies like beets, carrots, and potatoes will steam for longer than delicate foods like leafy greens.
Fish and Shellfish: For more flavorful results, broth or wine can be used instead of water. Fish stays tender and shellfish like clams, mussels, lobster, or crabs are cooked inside their shells.
Desserts: Some types of desserts are steamed rather than baked, producing a moist, silky texture. Creme brulee, flan, and panna cotta are all custards made by steaming.
Tamales: Tamales are a popular food made by steaming masa, a dough made of ground corn, and fillings inside a corn husk packet. The steam makes the corn dough tender and moist.
