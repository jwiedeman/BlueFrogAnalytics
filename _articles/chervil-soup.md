title: Chervil Soup
subtitle: Kerbelsuppe <br> Gründonnerstag is the Thursday before Easter, known as Maundy Thursday. It means "Green Thursday," although it is thought that the word "grün" is actually derived from the word "greinen" meaning to weep. However, despite there being nothing traditionally green about "Green Thursday," Germans often eat green-colored foods such as herb soups.
