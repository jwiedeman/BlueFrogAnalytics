The Chocolate Martini is a decadent concoction that easily can double as dessert. It fell into disfavor for some time, shunned for its sweetness, but as many top-notch bars now offer their own renditions of an Espresso Martini, this drink is poised for a comeback as well. The key is using the highest-quality ingredients possible, such as Giffard creme de cacao and Godiva chocolate liqueur. 

It’s still plenty sweet, though, so keep in mind it’s far better as a nightcap than for kicking off an evening. Better yet, drink it as your dessert for a two-birds-with-one-stone effect.

### Ingredients

- Cocoa powder, to rim glass
- 1 ounce chocolate liqueur (such as Godiva), plus more for rimming glass 
- 1 ounce creme de cacao (such as Giffard)
- 1 ounce vodka
- 1/2 ounce half-and-half
