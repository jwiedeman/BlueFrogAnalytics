1. Dry Heat Cooking

Dry heat cooking works without the presence of any moisture, broth, or water. Instead, it relies on the circulation of hot air or contact with fat to transfer heat to foods. Temperatures of 300 degrees or hotter are used to create browning, a reaction where the amino acids and sugars in food turn brown and create a distinct aroma and flavor. The unique scents of toasted bread or seared meat are both examples of dry heat cooking at work.

Sauteing
Sauteing is performed over a burner in a hot, shallow pan and uses a small amount of oil or fat to coat food for even browning. This method cooks foods very quickly so it's best to keep the food moving by tossing or flipping. Saute is a French word that translates to "jump". To achieve great results with sauteing, make sure the oiled pan is hot before adding any food, don't overcrowd the pan with too many items, and stir or toss frequently.

Best foods for sauteing:

Meats: Sauteing cooks quickly, so tender meats work best. Use ground beef, tenderloin, or medallions in a saute pan. Small, uniformly sized cuts of meat brown evenly.
Poultry: Boneless breasts, strips, or cutlets can be sauteed to sear in flavor.
Vegetables: Zucchini, squash, and leafy greens can all be sauteed in olive oil or butter. Carrots, celery, and onions can also be sauteed and often make a flavorful base for other dishes.
