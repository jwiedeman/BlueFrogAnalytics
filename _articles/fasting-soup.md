title: Fasting Soup
subtitle: Whether used during Lent, at the New Year, or for a therapeutic fast, fasting soup provides valuable minerals and supports the detoxification process. Fasting soup is easy to cook at home, just like making a normal vegetable stock. Itâ€™s recommended to use organic ingredients here, and season without salt.
