App Lifecycle Events,"This package provides metrics required to track an app's lifecycle events, such as launches, closures, and user engagement over time. Lifecycle data is critical for understanding app usage patterns, retention, and session behavior.
Adobe allows the attachment of additional data to lifecycle events, which can be collected as a dictionary of values for deeper analysis. 

Ensure compliance with the Globally Required & Conditionally Required Global Dimensions.

App Backgrounding,"This package supports tracking when an app is sent to the background, enabling accurate measurement of session length and time spent in the app. Adobe’s out-of-the-box lifecycle tracking does not automatically capture app backgrounding events, making this package essential for apps requiring precise session tracking.
By firing the App Backgrounded event before the app is sent to the background, this package ensures the final hit of a session is recorded accurately.
Use Case:
Optimize time-on-app metrics by ensuring proper session closure data is captured.","Pages / Screens (Minimum Viable),Pages / Screens (Full),Fox X.ID",App Backgrounded (event267),,,,,,,,,
App Installing,"This package tracks app installation events to identify the source of app installs and measure the effectiveness of acquisition campaigns. Adobe’s out-of-the-box lifecycle tracking may not capture installs for all platforms, so this package is critical for platforms requiring explicit installation event tracking.
Implementation:
Fire the App Installed event after the app is launched for the first time. This event captures the installation source and acts as the first recorded event of the app.
Use Case:
Analyze user behavior and performance based on acquisition sources.","Pages / Screens (Minimum Viable),Pages / Screens (Full),Fox X.ID",,,,,,,,,,
