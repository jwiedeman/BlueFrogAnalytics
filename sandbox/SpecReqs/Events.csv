Ensure the event fires only for valid interactions and avoids accidental triggers, such as hover events.",281,Counter,"Pages: Content Level 1 (v1),Pages: Content Level 2 (v2),Pages: Content Level 3 (v3),Pages: Content Level 4 (v4),Pages (conversion) (v10),Detail Content: Name (v12),Detail Content: Type (v13),New vs Repeat Visitor (30 days) (v22),Experiment Name | Experiment Variation (v65),Page URL (v75),Registered User (v82),Nation Auto Login T/F (v87),Logged In Via Magic Link T/F (v89),User: XID (v143),Pages (conversion) (c10)Pages: Content Level 1 (c1),Pages: Content Level 2 (c2),Pages: Content Level 3 (c3),Pages: Content Level 4 (c4),Pages (conversion) (c10),Detail Content: Name (c12),Detail Content: Type (c13),Member Name/ID (c21),Alt Pages Report (c40),Prev Page Max | Initial % Viewed (c58),Viewport Width x CSS Pixel Height (c59),Pixel Density (c61),Device Orientation (c62),Ad Blocker (c63),Page URL (c75)","Pages: Content Level 1 (v1),Pages: Content Level 2 (v2),Pages: Content Level 3 (v3),Pages: Content Level 4 (v4),Pages (conversion) (v10),Detail Content: Name (v12),Detail Content: Type (v13),New vs Repeat Visitor (30 days) (v22),Experiment Name | Experiment Variation (v65),Page URL (v75),Registered User (v82),Nation Auto Login T/F (v87),Logged In Via Magic Link T/F (v89),User: XID (v143),Pages (conversion) (c10)","Pages: Content Level 1 (c1),Pages: Content Level 2 (c2),Pages: Content Level 3 (c3),Pages: Content Level 4 (c4),Pages (conversion) (c10),Detail Content: Name (c12),Detail Content: Type (c13),Member Name/ID (c21),Alt Pages Report (c40),Prev Page Max | Initial % Viewed (c58),Viewport Width x CSS Pixel Height (c59),Pixel Density (c61),Device Orientation (c62),Ad Blocker (c63),Page URL (c75)",,P2,"Trigger this event when a user interacts with an embedded third-party component (e.g., iframe, widget, or external tool) within a page.

- Trigger this event when a user interacts with a third-party component embedded in a page (e.g., clicking a button, submitting a form, or starting a video).
- Include all required and minimum viable dimensions in the event payload as outlined in the spec.
- Configure logic to fire only for confirmed interactions, avoiding accidental triggers (e.g., hover events).
QA Instructions:
- Validate the event triggers upon user interaction with third-party components across all platforms.
- Verify that the event payload includes all required and minimum viable dimensions.
- Test edge cases such as repeated or invalid interactions, ensuring no redundant or missed events.
- Use debugging tools to inspect event payloads and confirm metadata completeness and accuracy.
