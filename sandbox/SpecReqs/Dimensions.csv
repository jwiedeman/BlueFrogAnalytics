",P1 - Major,App & Site Attributes,,,,"Dev Notes:
1. Determine Preview Type Logic
    - For each homepage tile, identify the media preview type (e.g. muted video, Hola Spark preview, GIF, or image).
    - Use any existing logic or flags in your codebase that already detect the type of tile preview.
1. Set Data Layer & eVar Value
    - When the homepage tile is rendered (or when the user clicks), populate the data layer property (e.g., media_preview_type) with the appropriate string value.
    - Ensure the analytics beacon or event call includes this data layer value and maps it to v56.
1. Fallback Handling
    - If there is no preview type or the content is an article (non-video), assign a default value (e.g., ""Image"" if it uses a static thumbnail, or ""None"" if there's truly no preview).

QA Notes:
1. Test Homepage Tiles
    - Verify each tile variant (Muted Video Player, Hola Spark Powered Preview, GIF, Image) triggers the correct v56 value in Adobe Analytics.
    - Use debugging tools (e.g., the Network tab, Adobe Experience Cloud Debugger or Charles proxy) to confirm the data layer and analytics calls set the correct string.
1. Cross-Device & Cross-Browser Validation
    - Confirm the logic works consistently across desktop, mobile web, and any app implementations (if relevant).
1. Edge Cases
    - Confirm that non-video (article or live blog) tiles correctly set a default or fallback value for v56.
    - Check that no unexpected values appear in your reporting (e.g., typographical differences like “MutedVideoPlayer” or “Muted video” that break grouping in reports).
1. Reporting Validation
    - In your Adobe Analytics environment, verify the dimension is spelled correctly and that you see the expected buckets (i.e., “Muted Video Player,” “Hola Spark Powered Preview,” “Gif,” “Image,” and potentially “None” or “N/A”).
