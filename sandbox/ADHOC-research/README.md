# ADHOC Research

A small collection of experimental Python scripts used for quick research and prototyping.

## Contents
- **google-cwv-calculations.py** – calculates Core Web Vitals scores using a shaped log‑normal approach matching Google Lighthouse output.
- **rs.py** – scratchpad that queries Google Search and Wikipedia and uses OpenAI APIs to produce structured summaries.

## Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- Packages listed in each script (`requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `wikipedia-api`, `openai`, `google`)

## Usage
Run any script directly with Python:

```bash
python google-cwv-calculations.py
python rs.py
```

These utilities are ad‑hoc experiments and are not intended for production use.
