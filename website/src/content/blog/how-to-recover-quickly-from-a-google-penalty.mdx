---------------------------------------------------------------

A Google penalty can feel like an earthquake under your website. One day you're ranking, the next day traffic drops like a rock. Revenue plummets. Leads dry up. Panic sets in.

But here's the good news: it's not the end. While Google penalties can be devastating, recovery is possible---especially if you act methodically and decisively.

This guide will provide a maximum-depth, highly actionable walkthrough of how to detect, diagnose, and recover from a Google penalty. Whether it's algorithmic or manual, you'll learn how to clean up your site, regain Google's trust, and reestablish your SEO momentum.

A Google penalty is a negative impact on a website's search rankings caused by actions that violate Google's Webmaster Guidelines. It can be automatic (algorithmic) or manual (human-reviewed).

### 1.2 Manual vs. Algorithmic Penalties

-   **Manual Penalty**: Triggered by a manual review, often found in Google Search Console (GSC) under "Security & Manual Actions."
