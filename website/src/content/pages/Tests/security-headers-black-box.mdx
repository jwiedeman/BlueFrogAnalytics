Results display a table showing each header's value along with a pass/fail
status and guidance for improvement.

## Headers Tested

- **Content-Security-Policy** – Mitigates XSS and injection attacks by
  restricting the sources a page can load.
- **Strict-Transport-Security** – Forces HTTPS for a period of time and is
  important for any site served over TLS.
- **X-Content-Type-Options** – Prevents MIME sniffing; always recommended.
- **X-Frame-Options** – Stops clickjacking by controlling framing behavior.
- **Referrer-Policy** – Limits referrer information. Recommended but optional
  based on analytics needs.
- **Permissions-Policy** – Disables unused browser features such as geolocation
  or camera access.
- **Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy** – Restricts which origins can load your
  resources to prevent data leaks.
- **Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy** – Isolates your site from cross-origin side
  effects. Required for some advanced APIs.
- **Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy** – Works with COOP to enforce secure
  embedding; only needed for complex apps.
- **X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies** – Blocks Adobe products from loading
  cross-domain data. Mostly legacy.
- **Expect-CT** – Enables reporting for certificate transparency violations.

## Implementation Notes

**Data Points Needed**

- Response values of common security headers
- Recommended configurations for comparison

**Formula**

$$
\text{Score} = \sum_i w_i c_i
$$

where $c_i$ is 1 when header $i$ matches recommendations.
