# Analytics Implementation FAQ

### **What are the main ways to add analytics to my site?**
Most analytics tools support three primary methods:
1. **Native implementation** – embed the JavaScript snippet directly on each page.
2. **Tag manager** – load the analytics tag through Google Tag Manager, Tealium, or a similar system.
3. **Customer data platform (CDP)** – send data via Segment or another CDP that forwards events to analytics providers.

### **Which method is best for single‑page applications?**
Tag managers and CDPs work well because they can fire events without refreshing the page. Native scripts also work, but you must manually trigger page view events on route changes.

### **Can I install analytics in a mobile app?**
Yes. Most vendors offer SDKs for **iOS** and **Android**. You can integrate these natively or through cross‑platform frameworks like React Native.

### **How do I track server‑side events?**
Use the provider's REST API or server‑side SDK. This is helpful for ecommerce conversions or any event that happens outside the browser.

### **Is it possible to combine multiple methods?**
Absolutely. You might load Google Analytics via Tag Manager while sending custom events from your backend API.

### **What if my platform doesn't support JavaScript?**
Most analytics providers offer pixel tracking or HTTP endpoints so you can send data from static sites, emails, or other environments where JavaScript is limited.

### **Are there privacy concerns with these methods?**
Yes. Always ensure your implementation complies with regulations like GDPR or CCPA and provide users with clear opt‑out options.
