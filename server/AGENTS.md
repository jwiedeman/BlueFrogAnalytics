# API Server Tasks

This file tracks planned improvements for the Node.js backend under `server/`.

## Planned Improvements
1. Add unit tests for each API endpoint.
2. Cache Lighthouse audit results to reduce repeated processing.
3. Move rate limiting values into environment variables for easier tuning.
4. Document all available routes in the website docs.
