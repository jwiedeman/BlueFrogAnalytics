# Installation

Follow these steps to get a local copy of **Blue Frog Analytics** up and running.

## 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/BlueFrogAnalytics.git
cd BlueFrogAnalytics
```

## 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This installs the packages for both the API server and the documentation site.

## 3. Configure environment files

Copy the example environment files and add your Firebase and Cassandra settings:

```bash
cp server/.env.example server/.env
```

Edit these files with the appropriate credentials before continuing.

## 4. Start the API server

From the repository root run:

```bash
npm start
```

## 5. Launch the documentation site

In a new terminal window:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The site will be available at `http://localhost:4321`. Visit this URL to verify the installation.

With these steps completed you have a local Blue Frog Analytics environment for development and testing.
