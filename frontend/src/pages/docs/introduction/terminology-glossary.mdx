## A

### A/B Testing
A method of comparing two versions of a webpage, ad, or email to learn which drives better results. **Common arenas:** CRO, PPC, email. **Typical metrics:** click-through rate (CTR), conversion rate, bounce rate.

### Abandonment Rate
The percentage of users who start but don't finish a desired action (checkout, form, video, etc.). A core signal for conversion-flow triage.

### Above the Fold
The portion of a page visible without scrolling. **SEO/UX tip:** park your primary CTA, value prop, and proof points here.

### Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP)
A Google-backed framework that strips bloaty markup for lightning-fast mobile loads. **Pros:** speed, SERP carousel eligibility. **Cons:** design limits, Google cache dependency.

### Accessibility
Designing content so people with disabilities can use it. Guided by WCAG. Bonus: better UX + potential ranking lift.

### Account-Based Marketing
B2B strategy that targets high-value accounts with hyper-personalized, multi-channel campaigns instead of broad personas.

### Actionable Analytics
Insights translated directly into clear, measurable actions—no ivory-tower data pontificating allowed.

### Ad Extensions
Extra bits that expand a Google Ad: sitelinks, calls, locations, snippets, et al. Boost CTR and Quality Score when used well.

### Ad Fatigue
Performance decay caused by over-exposure to the same creative. Cure with fresh assets, tightened frequency caps, or new targets.

### Ad Impression
A single display of an ad, click or no click. Fundamental denominator for CPM and view-through math.

### Ad Inventory

### Ad Network
Middle-man platform that matches advertisers with publisher inventory (e.g., Google AdSense, Taboola).

### Ad Rank
Google Ads' placement algorithm. **Formula:** Bid × Quality Score × Ext. Impact. High rank means higher position at lower spend.

### Ad Retargeting
Serving ads to past visitors who left without converting. Runs on GDN, Meta, LinkedIn, YouTube, et cetera.

### Ads
Paid messages delivered through digital or offline channels to influence audience behavior—think search ads, display banners, social promos, video spots, even that podcast mid-roll. Core components: targeting + creative + placement. **Key success metrics:** impressions, click-through rate (CTR), cost-per-click (CPC), cost-per-acquisition (CPA), and return on ad spend (ROAS).

### Ad Server
Software that stores, targets, serves, and reports on digital ads (e.g., Google Ad Manager).

### Ad Viewability
How much of an ad was actually seen by users. Crucial for campaign performance evaluation.
