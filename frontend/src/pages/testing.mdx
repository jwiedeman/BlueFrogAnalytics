## Free Analytics Testing Suite

**REALITY CHECK:** Most businesses are losing 20-40% of their conversion data to tracking failures. These tools will show you exactly what's broken (and what it's costing you).  

<div class="container py-8">
  <div class="grid gap-6 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3">
    {tests.map(t => (
      <a href={t.slug} class="block border rounded-lg p-5 hover:bg-accent/40 transition-colors">
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-1">{t.title}</h3>
        <p class="text-sm text-muted-foreground">{t.description}</p>
      </a>
    ))}
  </div>

## Free vs. Paid: Choose Your Level of Protection

**FREE TOOLS:** Perfect for quick validation and identifying obvious issues.

**PAID AUDITS:** For businesses serious about stopping revenue hemorrhaging and building bulletproof systems. [See our services â†’](/services/)
