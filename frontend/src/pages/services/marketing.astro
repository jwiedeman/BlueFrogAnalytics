        Blue Frog Analytics monitors almost every reachable domain and
        automatically determines which ones belong to real businesses. We look
        for service pages, e-commerce sections and other signals to filter out
        personal sites and placeholders.
      </p>
      <p>
        Qualified domains are enriched with phone numbers, email addresses and
        technology details. Map listings help us tie many of these sites to
        physical locations, and coverage grows daily.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every domain also receives a Lighthouse audit, letting you pinpoint
        businesses with poor SEO, slow performance or missing analytics. These
        leads are cold but deeply researched and updated on a regular basis.
